# Simple Blockchain Implemented Using TypeScript

## Implement Simple Blockchain Structure
In this implementation, we created a minimal working blockchain with core functionalities, such as defining the structure of a block and a blockchain. We included essential block properties like index, data, timestamp, hash, and previousHash. We also implemented methods to generate new blocks, where each block references the hash of the previous one, ensuring data integrity. A genesis block was hardcoded to start the blockchain, and the blocks were stored in memory using a simple JavaScript array. To maintain blockchain integrity, we developed validation methods to check the structure and ensure consistency across blocks.

We also built mechanisms for syncing nodes and communicating with other peers in the network using WebSockets. When a node generates a block, it broadcasts the block to peers, and if a node encounters a longer blockchain, it replaces its own chain with the valid longer one. Additionally, a simple HTTP API was implemented to allow users to interact with the node, enabling them to list blocks, create new blocks, and manage peer connections. This forms the basic foundation of our blockchain, with plans to add proof-of-work in the next stage.
